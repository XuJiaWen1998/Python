#To Define an integer, use the following syntax
myint = 7
print(myint)

#To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)

#Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)
mystring = "hello"
print(mystring)

#The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes
mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print(mystring)

#Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
print(three)

hello = "hello"
world = "world"
helloworld = hello + " " + world
print(helloworld)

#This will not work!
one = 1
two = 2
hello = "hello"

#print(one + two + hello)
